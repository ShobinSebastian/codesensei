LLM Agent for Code Review
==========================
This module uses Large Language Models (like GPT, Claude, Mixtral) 
to analyze code with human-like reasoning.

Why use LLM for code review?
- Understands context (not just patterns)
- Can explain WHY something is wrong
- Finds logical errors static tools miss
- Provides educational feedback
